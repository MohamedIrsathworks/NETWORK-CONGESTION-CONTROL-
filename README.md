# NETWORK-CONGESTION-CONTROL-
This project implements and analyzes two key congestion control algorithms: Leaky Bucket and Token Bucket, designed to manage network traffic efficiently and prevent congestion. The simulation is built using Streamlit, offering real-time visualization of network performance metrics such as packet loss, bucket state, and throughput.
